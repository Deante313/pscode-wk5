b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Create input (5,10,15,20,25)
	List Input Average
	List Input Minimum 
	List Input Maximum 
			Print Average=(5,10,15,20,25)/5
			Print Minimum (Min=5)
			Print Maximum (Max=25)
